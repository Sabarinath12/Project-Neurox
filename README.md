# Project-Neurox v0.0.0.1
A next  generation  open source kernel for biomechatronics

                                             ===============
                                             Neurox Kernel
                                             ===============
                                             
A Linux inspired next-generation kernel made for human immortality and  biomechatronics The  kernel will be  helping  human body parts to be connected to machines which can give a life after death this may sound Sci-Fi but it's one of my ambitious projects the kernel will be open source. And is written in c++ . The python codes of the kernel will only be executed after boot-up of the neurox based os currently the development is in early stages.Anyone interested can involve in this project
